Feature: Testing basic calculator functionality

  Scenario: Basic addition is working
    Given I have number one as 30
    And I have number two as 40
    When I add both numbers
    Then the sum is 70

  Scenario: Basic addition is working with float
    Given I have number one float as 30.20
    And I have number two float as 40.30
    When I add both numbers
    Then the float sum is 70.50

  Scenario Outline: Basic addition is working with outline
    Given I have number one as <firstNo>
    And I have number two as <secondNo>
    When I add both numbers
    Then the sum is <sum>

    Examples:
    |firstNo|secondNo|sum|
    |10     |20      |30 |
    |20     |30      |50 |
    |30     |40      |70 |
    |40     |50      |90 |
